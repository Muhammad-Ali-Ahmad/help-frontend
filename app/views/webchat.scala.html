    <p>The Ask HMRC webchat is a service that enables you to communicate with an HMRC adviser over the internet.<p>

    <p>Ask HMRC webchat is built and run by Nuance, a provider of customer engagement software. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website and webchat. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
     <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
     <li>navigate most of the Webchat using just a keyboard</li>
     <li>navigate most of the Webchat using speech recognition software</li>
     <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/"> AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-large">How accessible this webchat is</h2>

    <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
     <li>At one point you have to hit the Done button twice to dismiss the keyboard and send a message</li>
     <li>At the top of the webchat window is a Print or end chat menu which screen readers may read out twice. The second instance is given the role of a button which is unresponsive</li>
     <li>If you’re using a screen reader you may need to tab past the footer of the webpage to find the webchat</li>
     <li>When the browser window is zoomed in, webchat may spill off the page</li>
     <li>There are some error messages in this service that may not be descriptive enough for some users with visual impairments, although they are compatible with common assistive technology tools</li>
     <li>Users may find that when the chat is finished, they cannot tab backwards through the chat</li>
     <li>To find the privacy and accessibility links, users should tab beyond the message input box</li>
     <li>Some screen readers may fail to tell the user whether the print-save menu is open or not</li>
     <li>Jaws stops reading out the chat conversation when the user is in the chat textbox. Users should click ‘tab button’ and click up arrow</li>
     <li>Users of Jaws may find they receive no notification that the agent has sent a message</li>
    </ul>

     How we tested this webchat
    </h2>

    <p>The service was last tested on 21/01/2020 and was checked for compliance with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard.</p>

    <p>The service was built using parts that will be tested by the Digital Accessibility Centre. The full service was tested by HMRC and included a disabled user.</p>

     What we’re doing to improve accessibility
    </h2>

    <p>We’re working with Nuance, the new provider of our webchat, to continuously improve the quality and accessibility of this service. Our accessibility experts also regularly review the webchat and make recommendations which we then pass to our supplier Nuance. We acknowledge that some adjustments are simple and immediate, but others require deeper analysis and development and will be slower to take effect.</p>
    <p>The accessibility of our webchat is therefore under constant scrutiny as we strive to move from partially to fully compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard by September 2020.</p>
